Carrying the objective by the player to be added in this lecture.

Create a boolean in header file of charater under public so we can access from FPSobjective class. we need to access it from blueprrint as well so do the following

	UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly, Category = "Gameplay" )
	bool bIsCarryingObjective;

Now we need to check if the overlap of the objective actor is the character. So do the following to ObjectiveActor CPP file.

include the character header file in the top

	#include "CharacterName.h" 

then
do the following 

	ACPPLesson02Character* MyCharacter = Cast<ACPPLesson02Character>(OtherActor);
	if (MyCharacter)
	{
		MyCharacter->bIsCarryingObjective = true;

		Destroy();
	}

Now fpsobjective should destroy as the player overlaps it.

To see if the boolean changes or not, we can do a print string in blueprints in the editor like normal ways. The boolean we created in cpp called bIsCarryingObjective will be accessable from blueprints.

Create Widget blueprint to display text "Object carried"
Create HUD. We can create a HUD from FPS HUD already in the project. (No need to create new)
Create and Add to Viewport in the begin play of the HUD
Create a GameMode derived from FPS Game Mode just like HUD and set the hud.
Set the GameMode in world settings

In the widget create bind display add different text based on the boolean variable in player character.

Exercise:
Add points to the player and collect points on overlapping the FPSObjective.
